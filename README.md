Stat 497R Tennis Interns Repository

This repository is for my 11 sweet interns who are working on a selected research project using BYU Women's tennis data. Interns, feel free to add any code you work on that I/the other interns might find interesting, but don't feel like you have to share your code. Just be sure not to change the ExampleCode.R file or the actual csv file. Feel free to email me if you have any questions! Good luck!
